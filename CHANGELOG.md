# Changelog

## 2026-09-28 — Canonical subdomain links
- Replaced legacy `scribnetai.github.io/<repo>/` links with canonical
  `https://<repo>.scribnet.io/` URLs (the old URLs 301-redirect, but docs and
  on-page links should point at the real address).

## 2026-09-28
- Added Umami website analytics (cookieless, no consent banner): pageview tracking plus custom events for ad-slot impression/click reporting.

## 2026-09-28
- Added a floating Feedback button (bottom-right) that opens a dialog to send feedback via email — topic chips, optional name, and message, addressed to the site owner with the app name in the subject.

## 2026-09-28
- TLS certificate provisioned for the `cargo-foundry.scribnet.io` custom domain (GitHub's stuck DNS check was reset 2026-09-28); HTTPS is now enforced on the site. App-switcher menu links switched from legacy `scribnetai.github.io` URLs to direct `https://<app>.scribnet.io` URLs for all 10 apps (footer/launcher links updated likewise). This entry also covers the net-zero CNAME delete/re-add commits from the DNS-check reset, which carried no changelog entries. Touched: index.html, js/app-switcher.js.


## 2026-09-27
- Added a favicon (inline SVG monogram badge, matching the other apps) so browser bookmarks and tabs show the app logo instead of a generic globe.
